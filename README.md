### Growth Mindset!

**_Keeping yourself in the growth mindset can be defined as virtue; you do not own virtue it is only something you can maintain. It is not easy, but allowing yourself to continually doublecheck yourself for errors (and here's the key part) AND be willing to change them continually day by day, using such virtues; patience, diligence, temperence, moderation, charity, faith, hope, etc....**_

# Growth Mindset!   ...and how to rmind myself day by day.
## increase my consciensous capacity each day so my mind may be actively engaged
## don't lean on my own understanding as I realize I have weaknesses; work to fix them
## be active in explaining my own understanding to others just for reciprocation...because of how little I know; ask for help

I hope you enjoyed reading my wonderful words.
